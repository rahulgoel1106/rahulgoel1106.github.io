								<p>Facial images disclose many hidden personal traits such as age, gender, race, health, emotion, and psychology. In this project, we
									have presented a novel method for classifying images using a pretrained
									transformer model and classify criminal & non-criminal using facial images. </p>

								</h2></a>
								<p>Studying segregation between populations of different ages, ethnicities and social classes has been a prominent theme for at least half a century. 
									To measure segregation, past works often use governmental surveys due to the scarcity of reliable data. In this project, we used call data records (CDR) provided by one of the largest mobile operators in Estonia, for studying segregation behavior based on gender, age, language and county.</p>

								<p>In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus (COVID-19). 
									The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. 
									Also, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world are non-uniform. 
									Inspired by these ideas, we propose two versions of our mobility-based SIR model, (i) fully mixed and (ii) for complex networks, which especially takes into account real-life interactions.

								<p>Online social media (OSM) has emerged as a prominent platform for debate on a wide range of issues. 
									Even celebrities and public figures often share their opinions on a variety of topics through OSM platforms. 
									One such subject that has gained a lot of coverage on Twitter is the Novel Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has sparked a crisis in human history. 
									In this study, we examine 29 million tweets over three months to study highly influential users, whom we refer to as leaders. 
									We recognize these leaders through social network techniques and analyse their tweets using text analysis. </p>

								<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00780.pdf"><h2>Do Facial Trait Correlates with Roll Call Voting in Parliament?</h2></a>
								<p>Research has shown that people recognize and select
									leaders based on their facial appearance. However, considering
									the correlation between the performance of leaders and their
									facial traits, empirical findings are mixed. This project adds to
									the debate by focusing on two previously understudied aspects
									of facial traits among political leaders: (i) previous studies
									have focused on electoral success and achievement drive of
									politicians omitting their actual daily performance after elections; (ii) previous research has analyzed individual politicians
									omitting the context of social circumstances which potentially
									influence their performance.</p>

								<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00941.pdf"><h2>Misinformation Detection on YouTube</h2></a>
								<p>Millions of people use platforms such as YouTube,
									Facebook, Twitter, and other mass media. Due to the accessibility
									of these platforms, they are often used to establish a narrative,
									conduct propaganda, and disseminate misinformation. This project
									uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques
									to extract features from video captions (subtitles) classifying videos as misinformation or not.</p>

								<p>In recent years, social media has provided platforms for raising the voice against sexual harassment (SH). The MeToo movement is
									one such online movement that aims to show the magnitude of this stigmatized issue in society.</p>

								<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437118314523"><h2>Competitive Marketing</h2></a>
								<p>A model is developed in which two players compete to spread information in the large network. Players choose their initial seed nodes simultaneously and the information is diffused according to Independent Cascade model (ICM). 
									The main aim of the player is to choose the seed nodes such that they will spread its information to as many nodes as possible in a social network.</p>
